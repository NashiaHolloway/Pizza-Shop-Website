# Pizza-Shop-Website
Nashia's Pizzaria website created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and implementing Google's map API.  NOTE: When coming up with a name, I searched for both "Pizzeria" and "Pizzaria" and both seemed to be used, however "Pizzeria" seems to be the "correct" version of the word.  I apologize to all the Italians in the world for my mistake.
